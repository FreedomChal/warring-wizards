Flask web application which runs an online multiplayer combat clicker game
---
## Instructions for running
This app is designed to be run on Heroku. However, it can also be easily run locally by executing "flask run" in the project directory. Note that the requirements must be installed, and Flask must be added to PATH. Also, this app cannot be run in CS50 IDE, due to flask-socketio not working correctly.
