# warring-wizards
Flask web application which runs an online multiplayer combat clicker game
---
Final project for the course CS50, taken through Harvard Extension School.
## Instructions for running
This app runs on Heroku at "https://warring-wizards.herokuapp.com", via GitHub deployment. However, it can also be run locally.

Before the application can run, the necessary dependencies in requirements.txt must be installed. Also, Flask must be added to PATH for command line execution of Flask.

Once the requirements are satisfied, clone this repository, and execute "flask run" in its main directory from a terminal. The app will then run at "http://localhost:5000/"

Note that this app cannot be run in CS50 IDE, due to conflictions with the flask-socketio library.
